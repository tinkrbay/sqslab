Next, navigate to the xy-mycsvfiles-sqs-lab S3 bucket. Edit the properties > events > notifications on the bucket to send all PUT messages to s3-puts queue
Create an IAM role > select EC2 as the service use-case > Attach direct policies > select Adminstrator Access policy 
Save the role as ec2sqslabfulladmin
Launch an EC2 instance with Amazon Linux 1 AMI in North Virginia (Amazon Linux AMI 2018.03.0 (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-0ff8a91507f77f867) 
Ensure that an IAM role ec2sqslabfulladmin is attached during launch
SSH into the EC2 instance and execute the below commands.
It installs the required packages to run the SQS worker along with a worker application and the supporting code

****PLEASE NOTE THE CHANGES REQUIRED IN THE TWO "sed" COMMANDS****

sudo su 
yum install jq -y
cd /home/ec2-user/
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.32.0/install.sh | bash
. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm install 4.4.5
mkdir -p worker
cd worker
npm install d3-dsv
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/labs.thecloudgarage.com/SQS/variation-s3-download-upload/s3-down-up.sh
sed -i -- 's/ABCDEFGHIJKL/replacewithyouraccountid/g' /home/ec2-user/worker/s3-down-up.sh
sed -i -- 's/xy/replacewithyourfirstlastinitialsusedinthebucket/g' /home/ec2-user/worker/s3-down-up.sh
tr -d '\r' <s3-down-up.sh >s3-down-up-new.sh
rm -rf s3-down-up.sh
sudo mv s3-down-up-new.sh s3-down-up.sh
chmod +x s3-down-up.sh

Execute the below commands on EC2 to set the region for the AWS user profile

aws configure
leave the access key and secret access key blank
region: us-east-1 
output: json

Create an AMI of this instance and name/description/name-tag: sqs-s3-puts-worker

Download the zip file on to your laptop and unzip the same. 

https://s3.amazonaws.com/labs.thecloudgarage.com/SQS/variation-s3-download-upload/csv.zip

There are about 50 csv sample files in the unzipped folder

Upload these csv files directly to the S3 bucket name xy-mycsvfiles-sqs-lab

Launch 2 more instances in us-east-1 public subnet from this AMI

SSH to all three instances and run the below commands in parallel on all three instances

sudo su
cd worker
./s3-down-up.sh
